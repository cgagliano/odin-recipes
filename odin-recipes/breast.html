    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>An easy chicken breast recipe made with few ingredients. I use this as a basic baked chicken recipe when another recipe calls for cooked chicken. </p>
        <p>Looking for a quick and easy treat to whip up on a whim? Your search ends with this easy peanut butter cookie recipe. It's made with only three ingredients you likely already have on hand.</p>
        
        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Â¼ cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly butter a baking dish.</li>
            <li>Stir together melted butter and salt in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Arrange chicken in the prepared baking dish. Brush butter mixture onto chicken until thoroughly coated, pouring any extra over chicken.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 30 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
